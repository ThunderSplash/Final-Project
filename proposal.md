## Description
I will be making either a 2D side scoller video game. Or a top down 2D action game. I feel that its relevant to the course because Python can be utilized for creating video games. And I would like to explore in depth all of what Python has to offer for video game programmers.  

## Features
- Player Health system
  - This will be implemented through video resources utilizing some code learned throughout the course and as well as through online tutorials.
- Enemy Health system
  - This will be implemented through video resources utilizing some code learned throughout the course and as well as through online tutorials.
- Player score
	- This will be implemented through video resources utilizing some code learned throughout the course and as well as through online tutorials.
- Rain\snow
	- This will be implemented through video resources utilizing some code learned throughout the course and as well as through online tutorials.
- Sound
	- This will be implemented through video resources utilizing some code learned throughout the course and as well as through online tutorials.
- Menu
	- This will be implemented through video resources utilizing some code learned throughout the course and as well as through online tutorials.
- HUD
	- This will be implemented through video resources utilizing some code learned throughout the course and as well as through online tutorials.
- Time Distortion
	- This will be implemented through video resources utilizing some code learned throughout the course and as well as through online tutorials.
- Quit option
	- This will be implemented through video resources utilizing some code learned throughout the course and as well as through online tutorials.
- Pause Menu
	- This will be implemented through video resources utilizing some code learned throughout the course and as well as through online tutorials.

## Challenges
- I will need to learn how to add sound effects, player health, emeny health, player score, snow, HUD, a Menu screen, Pause option, Quit option and time distortion.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- I will make a 2D side scroller platformer which will involve combat and time manipulation.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- As a bare minimum, I will at least need to create a working 2D side scroller game that will allow the player to move from one side of the map to the other.
