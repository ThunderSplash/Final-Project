# Final-Project
I will be making a 2D side scoller video game. I feel that its relevant to the course because Python can be utilized for creating video games. And I would like to explore in depth all of what Python has to offer for video game programmers. I realize that I have put a lot on my plate, but I feel that I can learn what is needed so that my vision will come to life. Prior to this course, I had no Python experience. So, I feel like this will be a great challenge on its own.
